					<h2>Redline Solutions.</h2>
					<p>We provide a suite of products and services that help companies reduce the time, cost, and risk of contract acquisition.

				<h2>Contract Readiness Review</h2>
				<h6>Know what you have - to get what you need</h6>
				<p>We start by reviewing your existing contract artifacts and existing templates, product offerings, customer and vendor contracts, and other relevant documentation to identify what you have and what you need.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="we_item_hr">
				<h2>Artifact Development</h2>
				<h6>Filling in the gaps</h6>
				<p>Based on the analysis of your contract artifacts and the model, we edit and draft a fully integrated set of document templates to make contracting based on your templates a ‘push button’ exercise. We also help you establish an end-to-end contracting process so your deals flow through predictable stages.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="we_item_hr">
				<h2>MARQUp - Deal Modeling</h2>
				<h6>Model Analysis of Risk and Quality</h6>
				<p>We build a deal model using our MARQUp to identify the terms that have direct impact on deal value. We score and track your deals against the model to show where the current deal deviates from your ‘standard’ deal - measuring objective deal risk and quality to support predictable deal revenue.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="we_item_hr">
				<h2>Deal Support/Deal Review</h2>
				<h6>Build - Test - Run</h6>
				<p>We support the entire deal acquisition process from establishing a contracts review process and establishing a contract template repository, to drafting and negotiating deals to closure using your model. Think of us as your fractional contracts department.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="we_item">
				<h2>MARQUp - Deal Analysis</h2>
				<h6>Deal Heat Map</h6>
				<p>MARQUp includes a ‘heat map’ feature to show you where a deal deviates from your model. You’ll be able to see at-a-glance where the current deal adds more risk than your model deal and develop a negotiation strategy - using what-if scenarios- to effectively address the risk.  MARQUp permits you to score both the initial draft of the deal and the final draft, so you can see how effective your negotiations were.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="we_item">
				<h2>MARQUp - Deal Tracking</h2>
				<h6>Know where you’ve been - to know where you’re going</h6>
				<p>MARQUp stores your deal scores so you understand deals in relation to each other over time. With your deal history, you can track how your deal risk changes over time, with each deal as your products and services, and deal processes mature.</p>

					<h2>Deal Modeling</h2>
					<h6>Model Analysis of Risk and Quality</h6>
					<p>We build a deal model reflecting the terms that effect the direct value of a deal to support predictable deal revenue. We score and track your deals against the model to show where the current deal deviates from your ‘standard’ deal - measuring objective deal risk and quality to support predictable deal revenue.  We even build a ‘heat map’ to show you where a deal deviates from your model.</p>
